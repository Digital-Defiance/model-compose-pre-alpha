# Pre-Alpha Phase Action Plan for model-compose

Pre-alpha phase for the "model compose" project. 


## 1. Concept Validation

### To-Dos:

1.1. Clearly define the problem the software is solving

> Standardise the ML development workflow, using the Docker infrastructure as a base. Centralise the versioning, management, visualization, reporting, and deployment of models in a reproducible manner.

1.2. Understand and outline your target audience or user persona.

> This might include data scientists, machine learning engineers, researchers, and other stakeholders involved in ML development and deployment.

1.3. Validate the concept through open source community feedback, surveys, and competitor analysis.

1.4. Document the key findings and insights.

## 2. Requirements Gathering & Analysis

### To-Dos:

2.1. Identify key stakeholders (users, contributors, etc.) and define their roles.

2.2. Gather detailed requirements through online feedback and discussion threads.

2.3. Analyze and document the gathered requirements.

2.4. Prioritize requirements based on feedback, community needs, and technical feasibility.

## 3. Software Design

### To-Dos:

3.1. Define and document the high-level architecture of the software.

3.2. Design and document the user interface layout and navigation (mockups, wireframes).

3.3. Plan database structure and data flow diagram.

3.4. Develop and finalize detailed design documents including software blueprints, diagrams, and technical specifications.

## 4. Development Plan

### To-Dos:

4.1. Define the development methodology (Waterfall, Agile, etc.).

4.2. Breakdown requirements into user stories or tasks.

4.3. Estimate the effort required for each task.

4.4. Create a project timeline.

## 5. Proof of Concept (PoC) & Prototyping

### To-Dos:

5.1. Develop a simple PoC or prototype for complex features.

5.2. Validate the feasibility of the prototype through community feedback.

5.3. Incorporate feedback and revise as necessary.

## 6. Setting Up Development Environment

### To-Dos:

6.1. Set up a coding environment (IDE, language/framework version, etc.).

6.2. Set up version control systems (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).

6.3. Define code review and branching strategies.

## 7. Preparing Test Environment

### To-Dos:

7.1. Plan and set up a testing environment similar to the production environment.

7.2. Prepare test data for different testing types (Unit, Integration, System).

7.3. Set up automated testing tools, if applicable.

## 8. Risk Assessment & Mitigation Plan

### To-Dos:

8.1. Identify potential project risks (technical, community acceptance, etc.)

8.2. Develop a risk mitigation plan.

8.3. Define contingency plans for high-impact risks.

## 9. Documentation Plan

### To-Dos:

9.1. Define the required documentation (technical, user manual, contributor guidelines, etc.)

9.2. Start documenting as you go.

## 10. Community Communication Plan

### To-Dos:

10.1. Establish a regular communication schedule with the community (updates, reports, etc.)

10.2. Open channels for discussion, feedback, and collaboration.

10.3. Use social media or relevant platforms to keep the community updated.
